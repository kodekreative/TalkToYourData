## üîç Lead Quality Indicators

### **CUSTOMER INTENT** (Primary Quality Metric)
**Values**: "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3", "Negative Intent", "Not Detected"
- **Business Logic**:
  - **Level 3**: Best intent - highest-quality leads requiring immediate attention
  - **Level 2**: Medium to high intent - moderate-quality leads with good conversion potential
  - **Level 1, Negative Intent, Not Detected**: Poor quality leads with minimal conversion potential
- **Quality Threshold**: Only Level 2 & 3 considered strong leads
- **Critical Rule**: **Level 3 non-conversions indicate sales execution problems**
- **Action Required**: All Level 2 & 3 leads need immediate follow-up

### **BILLABLE** 
**Values**: "Yes", "No"
- **Business Logic**: "No" = Publisher sending very poor quality leads
- **Quality Indicator**: Billable rate should be >70% for healthy publishers
- **Action Trigger**: Low billable rates require publisher review

### **DURATION** 
**Format**: "HH:MM:SS"
- **Business Logic**: Longer duration = better lead quality AND better sales execution
- **Quality Proxy**: Extended conversations indicate engagement
- **Benchmark**: >5 minutes typically indicates qualified interest

### **AD MISLED**
**Values**: "Yes", "No"
- **Business Logic**: "Yes" = Critical compliance violation
- **Action Required**: **Immediate publisher review and correction**
- **Reporting**: Must quantify total count and highlight offending publishers
- **Escalation**: **Zero tolerance policy** for misleading advertising

## üíº Sales Execution Indicators

### **Quote-to-Call Ratio**
**Formula**: `(QUOTE = "Yes" count √∑ Total Calls) √ó 100`
- **Business Logic**: Measures agent engagement and lead qualification
- **Benchmark**: Should be 40-60% for healthy operations

### **Quote-to-Sale Ratio**
**Formula**: `(SALE = "Yes" count √∑ QUOTE = "Yes" count) √ó 100`
- **Business Logic**: Measures closing ability
- **Critical Analysis**: If Quote-to-Call ‚â† Quote-to-Sale, indicates closing problems
- **Action Trigger**: <30% suggests sales training needed

### **OBJECTION WITH NO REBUTTAL**
**Values**: "Yes", "No"
- **Business Logic**: "Yes" = Poor agent performance indicator
- **Action Required**: Sales training and coaching needed
- **Performance Impact**: Directly correlates with lost sales opportunities

---

## üîß Operational Efficiency Indicators

### **REACHED AGENT**
**Values**: "Yes", "No"
- **Business Logic**: "No" = Buyer capacity/availability problem
- **Critical Threshold**: **>90% reach rate required**
- **Escalation Trigger**: Immediate management attention for low rates
- **Impact**: Direct revenue loss from missed opportunities

### **IVR**
**Values**: "Yes", "No"  
- **Business Logic**: "Yes" = Buyer may lack available agents
- **Analysis Focus**: Identify buyers susceptible to high IVR rates
- **Capacity Indicator**: High IVR rates suggest staffing issues

### **WAIT IN SEC**
**Data Type**: Numeric (seconds)
- **Business Logic**: Extended wait times reduce conversion rates
- **Benchmark**: <30 seconds optimal, >60 seconds problematic

## üìä Sales Process Quality Indicators

### **Stage Progression Analysis**
**Fields**: STAGE 1 through STAGE 5
- **Business Logic**: Higher stages = better performance (both lead quality and agent skill)
- **Quality Ranking**:
  - **Stage 5 (Enrollment)**: Highest quality outcome
  - **Stage 4 (Plan Detail)**: Strong engagement
  - **Stage 3 (Needs Analysis)**: Good qualification
  - **Stage 2 (Eligibility)**: Basic qualification
  - **Stage 1 (Introduction)**: Initial contact only

### **Stage Progression Rate**
**Formula**: `Stage N completions √∑ Stage N-1 completions √ó 100`
- **Analysis Use**: Identify where leads drop off in the funnel
- **Performance Indicator**: Higher stage completion = better execution

## üìà Multi-Agent Analysis Methodology

This framework enables the multi-agent system to:

1. **Automatically identify** whether issues stem from lead quality (publisher) or sales execution (buyer)
